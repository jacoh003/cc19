			Below are the three websites I chose:
		</h2>

		<section1>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>
					I Stand Between https://istandbetween.mengwencao.com/
				</h4>
			
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
							“I Stand Between” is a website that showcases the various experiences of ethnically Asian children who were adopted into white families. All adoptees seemed to share the same feeling of not being one thing or the other and having phases in their lives where they struggled to figure out their identity. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Aesthetically this website reminded me of a futuristic yearbook. The collaged pictures, personal voice recordings, and intimate close ups may not be what you’d usually find in a yearbook, but the idea is the same. Much like a high school yearbook this website is a collection of moments that attempts to sum up a part of someone’s life. 
							</p>
							<p>
 							This website made me wish that my own high school yearbook was in this format so that a yearbook could be something more personal and real that someone could look back at and reflect on. The digital format would also allow anyone to access their own yearbook from anywhere and any moment. 
 							</p>
 					</ul>
 			</ul>
 		</section1>
		<section2>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>
					New York City Map http://www.nycmap.com/
				</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
							This website was a “choose your own adventure” style game of exploring New York City. Having been made in the late 90’s, it is not the most complicated games but there is a certain charm and its simplicity. You navigate through the game by clicking which direction you want to go in, and the link will lead you to a new page that shows a different setting. Each page has a simple photos and audio that captures New York during that time.
							</p>
							<p>
							This website reminds me of my first game-coding experience I had in high school. I was in an introductory programming class that coded with python and the class mainly focused on programming robots to do things and making very simple games with graphics. Before we got into making games with graphics, we had to learn how to make text-based games. Though we were limited to just using text I realized that even if the game looks simple on the surface, there was so much code to write just to have multiple paths and endings to the game.
							</p>
 					</ul>
 			</ul>
 		</section2>
		<section3>
			<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>	
					Trying Trying http://tryingtrying.com/
				</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
							“Trying Trying” is a trippy psychedelic website that has a moving graphic that seems to build up into mountains of vibrant colors while an infinitely rising audio illusion plays in the background. 
							</p>
							<p>
							This website reminded me of an iPhone app that was released to promote a son by Cassius called “I Love You So.” This was an interactive app where the user could choose what kind of mouth lip-sync the artist’s song on the screen, and then could hold it up to their mouths to make their face and the screen look like one unit. 
							</p>
							<p>
							I think more artists should promote their music through creative apps or dedicating a whole web page to a music video. The music videos could be similar to “Trying Trying” and only be one page or it could be an interactive website. I think it would be a good way to cut away from the typical way promoting music and add another artistic aspect to the song artist’s creation.
