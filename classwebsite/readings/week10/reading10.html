		<h1> Week 10: Reading Response </h1>
		<br></br><p1>QUESTION:<br></br>
		Adding to the article, why do you see value in nonlinear narratives? When do you think they are more appropriate than linear narratives?
		<br></br>How does the history of hypertext/hypermedia discussed at the beginning of this semester connect to the concepts and projects discussed in this article?
		<br></br>Can you find a web-based non-linear narrative project not mentioned in this article? Share the link!
		</p1>

		<br></br><p1>RESPONSE: </p1>

		<br></br><p1> Nonlinear narratives could also how teachers teach in a classroom setting. By making the learning process more interactive, giving the student the option to dive deeper into topics that catch their attention, or allowing them easy access to different versions of a topic they are confused about, it makes the whole process a lot more fun. Making any process more fun would make that iformation stick more in a students head. It would also give them more motivation to learn because they would no longer be flipping through a textbook which feels so rigid due to its linear nature. Non-linear narratives would be more appropriate than a linear narrative especially if theres more than one way of telling a story or event. Even something that seems so permanent and factual as history has hundreds of perspectives you could explore the topic through. 

		<br></br>This topic relates to hypertext/hypermedia because it is another form of it. Just like how hypertext/hypermedia is the basis of choose your own adventure games, one could compare all of the examples of nonlinear narratives in this article to a choose your own adventure game that is refined and shaped to fit each topic that is being shared. If each path of non-linear narratives were to be mapped out it would look similar to the paths of any website with hypertext/hypermedia. 

		<br></br> This website called <a href="https://jundtkatie.github.io/s18_Non_Linear_Narritives/Collections%20Microsite/V9/index.html">Different Buckets</a> allows you to reexamine the idea of collections, and how you can categorize things from different classifications to create completely new collections from the same source of "things."
