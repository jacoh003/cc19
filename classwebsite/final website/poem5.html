</h1></div>

		<div class="poem">

		<p>I</p>
		<p><br></br></p>
		<p>As the blind Milton's memory of light,</p>
		<p>The deaf Beethoven's phantasy of tone,</p>
		<p>Wroght joys for them surpassing all things known</p>
		<p>In our restricted sphere of sound and sight,--</p>
		<p>So while the glaring streets of brick and stone</p>
		<p>Vix with heat, noise, and dust from morn till night,</p>
		<p>I will give rein to Fancy, taking flight</p>
		<p>From dismal now and here, and dwell alone</p>
		<p>With new-enfranchised senses. All day long,</p>
		<p>Think ye 't is I, who sit 'twixt darkened walls,</p>
		<p>While ye chase beauty over land and sea?</p>
		<p>Uplift on wings of some rare poet's song</p>
		<p>Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls,</p>
		<p>I soar cloud-high, free as the winds are free.</p>
		<p><br></br></p>
		<p>II</p>
		<p><br></br></p>
		<p>Who grasps the substance? who 'mid shadows strays?</p>
		<p>He who within some dark-bright wood reclines,</p>
		<p>'Twixt sleep and waking, where the needled pines</p>
		<p>Have cushioned al his couch with soft brown sprays?</p>
		<p>He notes not how the living water shines,</p>
		<p>Trembling along the cliff, a flickering haze,</p>
		<p>Brimming a wine-bright pool, nor lifts his gaze</p>
		<p>To read the ancient wonders and the signs.</p>
		<p>Does he possess the actual, or do I,</p>
		<p>Who paint on air more than his sense receives,</p>
		<p>The glittering pine-tufts with closed eyes behold,</p>
		<p>Breathe the strong resinous perfume, see the sky</p>
		<p>Quiver like azure flame between the leaves,</p>
		<p>And open unseen gates with key of gold?</p>
