		<div class="poem">
			<p>The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square</p>
			<p>With the new city street it has to wear</p>
			<p>A number in. But what about the brook</p>
			<p>That held the house as in an elbow-crook?</p>
			<p>I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength</p>
			<p>And impulse, having dipped a finger length</p>
			<p>And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed</p>
			<p>A flower to try its currents where they crossed.</p>
			<p>The meadow grass could be cemented down</p>
			<p>From growing under pavements of a town;</p>
			<p>The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.</p>
			<p>Is water wood to serve a brook the same?</p>
			<p>How else dispose of an immortal force</p>
			<p>No longer needed? Staunch it at its source</p>
			<p>With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown</p>
			<p>Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone</p>
			<p>In fetid darkness still to live and run --</p>
			<p>And all for nothing it had ever done</p>
			<p>Except forget to go in fear perhaps.</p>
			<p>No one would know except for ancient maps</p>
			<p>That such a brook ran water. But I wonder</p>
			<p>If from its being kept forever under,</p>
			<p>The thoughts may not have risen that so keep</p>
			<p>This new-built city from both work and sleep.</p>
