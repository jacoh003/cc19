		<div class="poem">
			<p>To one who has been long in city pent,</p>
			<p>'Tis very sweet to look into the fair</p>
			<p>And open face of heaven,--to breathe a prayer</p>
			<p>Full in the smile of the blue firmament.</p>
			<p>Who is more happy, when, with heart's content,</p>
			<p>Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair</p>
			<p>Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair</p>
			<p>And gentle tale of love and languishment?</p>
			<p>Returning home at evening, with an ear</p>
			<p>Catching the notes of Philomel,--an eye</p>
			<p>Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career,</p>
			<p>He mourns that day so soon has glided by:</p>
			<p>E'en like the passage of an angel's tear</p>
			<p>That falls through the clear ether silently.</p>
