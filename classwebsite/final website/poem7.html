		<div class="poem">
			<p>The trees along this city street,
			<p>Save for the traffic and the trains,
			<p>Would make a sound as thin and sweet
			<p>As trees in country lanes.
			<p><br></br></p>
			<p>And people standing in their shade
			<p>Out of a shower, undoubtedly
			<p>Would hear such music as is made
			<p>Upon a country tree.
			<p><br></br></p>
			<p>Oh, little leaves that are so dumb
			<p>Against the shrieking city air,
			<p>I watch you when the wind has come,—
			<p>I know what sound is there.
