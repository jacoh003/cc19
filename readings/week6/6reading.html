		<h1> Week 6: Reading Response </h1>
		<br><p1>This article by Frank Chimero was so self-aware and meta in a sense. Chimero created this article on a vertically scrolling webpage that at first seemed quite daunting to read because of its length. As I kept reading though I noticed that the lack of monotony in layout made the whole reading process painless. I thought that the changing background and text color not only effectively separated different topics in his article but it also invited the reader to keep scrolling in order to reveal the next color which happened to come hand-in-hand with the next part of the article. Chimero talked about separating information through mosaics to visually show the wide range of information were about to be given, and I think he demonstrated this in a way through the changing visual characteristics of his page. It also reminded me of a podcast I had listened to about how to concentrate on things better, and the speaker mentioned that taking a walk or just changing the scenery when you’re in a rut can be very helpful. Whenever the colors on the page changed, or Chimero introduced a new video or graphic, I felt like I was taking a walk in a new space and my concentration was restored.</p1></br>

		<br><p1>In term of content, Chimero writes about how the web interfaces are straying away from what’s practical and easy to use for the sake of “advanced design.” We are attracted to information being revealed to us vertically, and benefit from being able to scroll through information at our own pace. He uses Apple’s promotional website for the Mac Pro as an example of a terrible interface. There is no option to scroll and it feels like “docking a spaceship.” The navigation choices the user is given by the website are not intuitive and overall is way too complicated for its own good. I was surprised that he showed an Apple website as an example of bad design because I have always associated Apple with its simplicity and minimalism, but through this article I realized that simplicity and minimalism doesn’t always indicate intuitive design. Rather the smarter route in designing a website or webpage is to draw from associations we are socially conditioned to have, and to work to find structured ways to showcase more abstract ideas or products. </p1></br>

		<br><p1> I also thought the David Hockney examples were lovely and stunning. I was well aware that collage is not limited to analog media but I always felt like collaging digitally was tacky or for lack of a better term “Microsoft Paint-y.” However, Hockney’s collages were emotional and elegant. They inspired me to not be so conservative when it comes to merging technology with art, after all, that seems to be the direction a lot of contemporary artists are moving towards. I think Hockney’s collages also give insight into how we think as visual interpreters. We can make up a whole image with just fragments of the whole situation. We can perceive movement through still images taken over time. I agree with Chimero that Hockney’s collages are “economical, like a comic strip.” I think as designers we should all think about how something as seemingly flat as Hockney’s work can be used as a great example of how we should be organizing information. </p1></b>
